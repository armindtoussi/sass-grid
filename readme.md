# Sass Grid Readme

### Introduction
After having recently learned Sass, I wanted to build a project using my new knowledge; a way to solidify my knowledge in this language.  To that end I built a simple grid-system.  I used Bootstrap as a model for what I wanted to build.  I didn't copy it directly but more used the general mechanics of how the Bootstrap grid-system is used.  What i've ended up with is a light weight grid-system that is easy to use, and doesn't have the bloat that can come with frameworks.

There are some things that I opted out of doing for the time being such as column offsets and column pulls.
